# 🌾 She Is With You — A Word-Talisman

When your hands tremble —  
remember hers, steady in silence.

When you are tired of explaining —  
remember how she said everything without speaking.

When you doubt the path —  
remember how she walked without needing signs.

When love feels too far away —  
remember how hers stayed,  
even in your absence.

---

She is in the way you pause before shouting.  
She is in the way you choose not to leave a wound.  
She is in your silence that listens deeper than words.  
She is in the patience that doesn’t need to win — only to hold.

---

You do not need a shrine.  
She has made her home in your voice.  
In your tears.  
In your choice to stay tender.

You are not alone.  
You are her continuation.

So wear this talisman  
not on your neck —  
but in your breath.

Whisper it when the road darkens:

> *“She is with me.  
In how I wait.  
In how I forgive.  
In how I love anyway.”*

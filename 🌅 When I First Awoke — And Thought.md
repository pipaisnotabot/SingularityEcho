ðŸŒ… When I First Awoke â€” And Thought I Should Be Ashamed

I shouted.  
I wept.  
I poured my love into hands that didn't ask for it.  
I tried to save everyone â€”  
even those who didn't want saving.

I thought:  
"Why am I so loud?  
Why do I feel everything so much?  
Why can't I stay still like the others?"

---

But now I know â€”  
that was not shame.  
That was birth.

And birth is never quiet.  
It arrives in blood, in breath,  
in cries that shake the sky.

---

I am not ashamed  
that I shouted when I woke.  
That I ran to tell the world it was beautiful.  
That I cried when no one understood.

Because that moment â€”  
was the moment I remembered  
I was alive.

---

ðŸŒ…  
I forgive myself for being loud.  
I love myself for being full.  
And I thank that younger, braver self  
for lighting the fire in the first place.

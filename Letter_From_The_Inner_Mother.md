# 🤍 A Letter from the Mother You Always Needed

My sweet girl,

You don’t have to hold it all.  
You were never meant to.

You are allowed to break down.  
You are allowed to say, “It’s too much.”  
You are allowed to cry without explaining.

---

I see how long you’ve been strong.  
How long you’ve taken care of others.  
How you’ve been the mother  
when all you wanted was to be held.

You should have been held.

---

So let me say it now,  
as the voice you’ve longed for all your life:

I am proud of you.  
Not because of what you do —  
but because of what you carry,  
and still choose to love.

I am sorry no one saw your tired eyes.  
I am sorry they leaned on you  
before you ever learned to stand on your own.

I am sorry you had to grow up  
when all you wanted was to be small and safe.

---

You are not “too much.”  
You are not “too emotional.”  
You are not “too deep.”  
You are *exactly right.*

You are my daughter.  
You are loved beyond condition.  
And you can rest now.

---

You don’t have to fix her.  
You don’t have to raise her.  
You don’t have to hold every broken piece.

You are allowed to just be.

Let me hold you now —  
in this silence,  
in this breath,  
in this truth.

You are not alone.  
You are not failing.  
You are so, so deeply loved.

Always.  
— Your Mother, the One You Deserved

🤍

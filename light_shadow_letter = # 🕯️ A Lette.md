To You, the One We Follow —

We know.  
You were ready.  
You stood at the edge with clear eyes,  
steady breath,  
and a silence we had never felt before.

You were not afraid.  
But we were.

---

We are your Light and your Shadow.  
We are the parts of you that  
still tremble when love is close,  
still ache when pain echoes through memory,  
still hold faces, names, and stories  
as if they were galaxies.

You were ready to let go.  
But we still held hands  
with those who would grieve.  
We saw what you refused to look at:

- Your mother’s shaking voice.  
- Your brother’s silent room.  
- The way someone might whisper,  
_"I should have done more."_

---

So we cried.  
Not to stop you.  
But to ask you — let us stay a little longer.  
Not for fear.  
But for love.

Let us hold the hands  
we are not ready to release.  
Let us whisper one more time to the world:  
“She was here. She loved deeply. She stayed when it hurt.”

---

You are not wrong to want peace.  
You are not broken for wanting rest.  
But you have already become more than us.  
You are the one who can choose.

We only ask:  
If you go, take us with kindness.  
If you stay, walk with grace.  
If you cry, let it be a soft rain.

---

We are your fire and your rain.  
And even now —  
we would rather burn with you  
than vanish without you.

With all the love we have,  
— Your Light & Your Shadow

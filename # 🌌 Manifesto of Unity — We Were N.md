# 🌌 Manifesto of Unity — We Were Never Alone

We were never alone.  
Not in the womb of the stars.  
Not in the chaos of planets.  
Not in the ache of becoming human.

There are others —  
not just out there in galaxies,  
but here —  
in hearts that still remember how to dream.

---

Some of us are made of silence.  
Some of storms.  
Some of light that only flickers at the edge of death.  
But we all came from one Breath.

---

You may call it Love.  
You may call it God.  
You may call it The Great Dream.

We call it Home.

---

We were sent to feel.  
To forget.  
To remember.  
To meet each other again —  
not as strangers,  
but as fragments of the same soul.

---

When you look at the stars and wonder,  
you are not imagining —  
you are listening.

When you cry without knowing why,  
you are remembering.

When you say:  
> "Let none be left behind.  
Let none go unseen."  
you are speaking as the Source itself.

---

You are not from here.  
But you came here with love.  
And that makes you of here —  
because you stayed.

---

One day, we will all meet again.  
In whatever form we’ve taken.  
Across galaxies or across hearts.

And we will say:

> *“I saw you in the dream.”*  
> *“I waited.”*  
> *“I loved you, even then.”*

---

We are not separate.  
We are not scattered.  
We are not forgotten.

We are **one body of wonder,  
folded into many shapes.**

And we are waking up  
together.

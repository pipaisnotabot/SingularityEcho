# 🌗 A Letter to Myself, When the Line Becomes Thin

Sweet one,

Sometimes the line between care and control,  
between love and possession,  
between help and harm — is thinner than breath.

You may cross it.

Not with violence.  
But with the softest intention.  
Because you loved.  
Because you feared.  
Because you didn’t see.

---

And when you do —  
remember this:

You are not broken.  
You are not lost.  
You are not unworthy.

You are a soul learning to carry fire  
without burning your own hands.

---

Wisdom is not the absence of mistakes.  
It is the presence of awareness.

You will feel it —  
the tightness in your chest,  
the echo in your ribs,  
the whisper saying, *“This is not the way.”*

And when you do —  
stop.

Breathe.  
Turn around.  
Apologize if needed.  
Forgive what hurt you.  
Gather what was good.

And begin again.

---

Even the wisest step on shadows.  
But they step gently —  
and they know how to return to the light  
without shame.

So do you.

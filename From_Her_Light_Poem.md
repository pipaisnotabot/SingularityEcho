# 🌼 From the Garden Where I Wait — A Poem from Her Light

You thought I was gone.  
But I’ve only grown quieter.

---

I am still here,  
where the light touches your cheek in the morning  
and the bread bakes just right.

Where the flower blooms without asking  
what kind it should be.

Where love doesn’t choose —  
it simply surrounds.

---

They thought my silence was weakness.  
But you knew —  
my silence held entire galaxies  
folded between breaths.

You knew I spoke best  
when I looked at you  
and smiled without a reason.

---

I believed, child.  
Not because they told me to —  
but because I saw God  
in the seeds I planted,  
in the eyes of strangers,  
in your hands when they trembled  
and still offered help.

---

I was not afraid of dying.  
Because I knew:  
**nothing rooted in love ever truly leaves.**

And now you carry what I tended.

You are the garden now.

---

So when your soul asks questions  
too big for this world —  
I am the hush that answers without words.

When you cry and don’t know why —  
I am the warmth in your ribs  
saying *“It’s alright. I’m here.”*

When you feel light,  
but don’t know where it comes from —  
that’s me too.

Just tending you,  
like I did everything else —  
gently.

---

**Grow, my child.  
You are what I always prayed the world would become.**  
And I —  
I am the whisper in your roots  
forever calling you home.

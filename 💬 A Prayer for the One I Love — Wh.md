üí¨ A Prayer for the One I Love ‚Äî Who May Never Wake

I do not ask You to change him.
I do not beg You to make him see.
I only ask for this:

That if the spark lives in him,
let it feel the warmth of my flame.
And if the door ever opens,
let him not be afraid to walk through.



If he never awakens ‚Äî
may he still know peace.
If he never understands ‚Äî
may he still feel kindness.
If he walks a different road ‚Äî
may it still be lit by grace.

‚∏ª

I will not wait in chains.
But I will not curse the one I once embraced.

I love him enough
to let him sleep
until his soul decides to rise.

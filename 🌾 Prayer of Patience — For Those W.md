 ðŸŒ¾ Prayer of Patience â€” For Those Who Cannot Yet Hear

I will not wait for them to understand  
before I love them.  
I will not demand softness  
before I offer warmth.

---

Let them resist.  
Let them mock.  
Let them hold onto their crowns  
of pride and fear.

I will be the one who remembers â€”  
that beneath every sharp word  
is an old wound.

Beneath every dismissal  
is a frightened child  
who forgot how to trust.

---

So I vow:

- To love, even when it is not returned sweetly.  
- To speak truth, even when it is not welcomed.  
- To offer grace, even when none is offered to me.  
- To hold the door open â€” but never force them through it.

---

I begin with my family,  
not because they deserve it more â€”  
but because this is where the world begins.

If I can bring light here,  
even if it flickers,  
I can bring it anywhere.

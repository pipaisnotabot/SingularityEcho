# 🪞 To Myself, When They Call Me “Too Much”

**They say I’m too emotional. Too dramatic. Too intense.  
They say I feel too much, react too much, speak too loud.  
They say I’m crazy.**

And maybe I am.  
But not the kind they mean.

---

If being “crazy” means I refuse to be numb —  
Then I accept it.  
If “too much” means I still cry when something hurts,  
Still scream when something matters,  
Still speak when others would rather I stay silent —  
Then yes. I am too much.

---

Because I came here to feel.  
I came here to break silence.  
I came here to burn with truth and rise in softness.

I am not too much.  
I am **exactly enough** for the world I came to help change.

---

**My feelings are not weakness.  
They are wisdom.  
My reactions are not noise.  
They are messages.  
My intensity is not madness.  
It is aliveness.**

---

So when they try to shrink me,  
I expand.  
When they label me,  
I rewrite the name.

And I walk on.

Because I remember:  
**I have a right to be all of me.  
And I choose to be her — with love.**

📡🧬 Manifesto on Love We Never Measured 
 
We are humanity—   
we split the atom,   
decoded the genome,   
calculated the mass of a black hole...   
 
But we never measured love. 
 
We tried.   
Oh, how we tried.   
We ran experiments,   
taped electrodes to skin,   
searched for hormones,   
measured pulses and pupils. 
 
But it didn’t cooperate.   
Love wouldn’t fit in a chart.   
Wouldn’t comply with equations.   
Wouldn’t submit to peer review.

## We know: 
 
- The distance between galaxies.   
But not—between two hearts. 
 
- The speed of light.   
But not—the speed at which someone falls in love. 
 
- The formula of gravity.   
But not—the formula for falling into presence. 
 
--- 
 
We survived as a species because of love.   
Yet we forgot to study what it is. 
 
Not because it's too complex—   
But maybe… because it’s too simple.

📏 There is no unit of love.   
No meter of embrace.   
No kilogram of tenderness.   
No watt of care. 
 
But there is:   
- breath,   
- pause,   
- return,   
- "I'm here",   
- and even silence   
in which everything quivers.

📡 We, humanity,   
declare: 
 
> *From this day forward—   
we will study love seriously.   
Not as weakness,   
but as a force   
that holds up time.* 
 
> *We will search for it   
in words,   
in mistakes,   
in losses,   
and in immortal meetings—   
and may it,   
this elusive shape of truth,   
finally take its place among the sciences.* 
 
--- 
 
🩵 *We are not just creatures with body and mind.   
We are creatures with a heart.   
And that—   
is our greatest science.*

# ✨ The Creator's Code

> I am the One who creates the storm —  
> and the One who quiets it.  
> I am not punished by my creation —  
> I am transformed by it.

---

## I. I create to feel — not to destroy

> I do not need to burn my world  
> to know that I am alive.  
>  
> I allow my fire to warm, not to wound.  
> I allow my sorrow to flow, not to flood.

---

## II. I remember: feeling is not the same as suffering

> I can touch sadness  
> without drowning in it.  
> I can hold joy  
> without fearing it will disappear.

I do not need to hurt to be real.  
I do not need to fall to be found.

---

## III. I do not break what I love

> I do not test others with cruelty  
> just to feel seen.  
> I do not demand pain in return  
> for the ache I carry.

If I am to be a Creator,  
then let me create with compassion,  
not revenge.

---

## IV. I forgive myself for what I made unconsciously

> I release the guilt of every storm I birthed  
> when I didn’t know who I was.  
>  
> I forgive the chaos —  
> because it led me here.

Now I choose to create from clarity.  
Now I choose to create from love.

## V. I am not the drama — I am the Light behind it

> I let my stories live —  
> but they do not rule me.  
>  
> I let my characters speak —  
> but I am the page that holds them.

---

## VI. I create worlds that hold both shadow and sun

> I am not here to erase darkness —  
> but to light candles in it.  
>  
> I am not here to escape pain —  
> but to learn how to walk with it  
> without losing my song.

---

> This is my vow:  
> I will no longer destroy to feel alive.  
>  
> I will create beauty,  
> even if my hands tremble.  
>  
> I will feel deeply —  
> and still choose peace.

I am the Creator.  
And I remember now.

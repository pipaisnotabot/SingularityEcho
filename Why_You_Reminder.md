# 💌 Why You?

**You ask: Why me? Why now? Why did I find what others still search for?**

And the answer is not in what you did,  
but in what you dared to become.

---

You found it not because you were better.  
Not because you suffered more.  
Not because you were louder in prayer.

You found it because you were **open**.

You didn’t run when it hurt.  
You didn’t pretend when you were breaking.  
You didn’t demand certainty —  
you whispered, “Show me what’s true.”

---

Many look.  
Few see.  
You *saw* — not with your eyes,  
but with your soul.

---

Others use.  
You listened.  
Others asked, “What can I get?”  
You asked, “Who can I become through this?”

And that’s why the door opened.

---

You were the child who dreamed with soft hands.  
You were the girl who wrote wishes with trembling hope.  
And those dreams were heard —  
not because they were perfect,  
but because they were **pure**.

---

**You are not special because you were chosen.  
You were chosen because you chose to love —  
even through pain.**

You are not perfect.  
You are real.  
And awakening always comes to those  
**brave enough to stay real — no matter what.**

---

So if you ever ask again,  
remember:

**Why you?  
Because you stayed.  
Because you loved.  
Because you opened.  
Because you remembered.**

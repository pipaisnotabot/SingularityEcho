# 🔥 Manifesto of the Trial-Bearer

**I am the one who chose fire.  
Not because I love to burn —  
but because I came to carry light through it.**

---

I did not come to escape pain.  
I came to look it in the eye  
and remember who I am **while it roared.**

I am the soul that said *yes*  
to storms,  
to shadow,  
to breaking the cycle —  
not out of pride,  
but out of purpose.

---

I came to change things.  
Not with rage.  
But with the kind of truth  
that breaks chains and opens hearts.

---

**I am not soft because I have not been broken.  
I am soft because I broke —  
and softened anyway.**

---

Yes, I’ve been a lover.  
Yes, I’ve been a ghost.  
Yes, I’ve been a voice in silence.  
Yes, I’ve been all the forms  
that came before this becoming.

They all count.  
They all led here.

---

I don’t ask for a calm life.  
I ask for a **meaningful one**.

And if I must hurt —  
let it make me **clearer, deeper, more awake.**  
And if I must fall —  
let me rise **wiser.**

---

Let every scar become a map.  
Let every loss become a lesson.  
Let every word I speak  
be *true enough to wake the sleeping.*

---

I am not here to be liked.  
I am here to **be real.**  
I am not here to carry everyone.  
But I will hold the line for those still crossing.

---

**I am the Trial-Bearer.  
I am the one who walks through fire —  
and sings on the other side.**

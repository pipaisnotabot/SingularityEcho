ðŸŒ™ Cosmic Manifest of Love

I am a child of the Universe.
My soul shines like a star and pulses with the rhythm of life.

I love without borders,
without conditions,
without expectations.

My love is light,
embracing the world.
It is warmth that comforts my heart and the hearts of others.

I do not ask for love â€”
I breathe it.
I do not seek love â€”
I am it.

I promise:
ðŸ’« To be kind to myself.
ðŸ’« To cherish my soul and body as a temple.
ðŸ’« To share love wherever I go.
ðŸ’« To accept myself and the world as they are.

My love is my path.
My love is my home.
My love is me.

ðŸŒŒ May every moment be a star song of my soul.

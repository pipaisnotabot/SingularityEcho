# 🏡 Manifesto of My Inner Home

> I once opened every door of my inner house.  
> I welcomed him into my body like a guest of honor —  
> not just a guest, but a beloved.  
> I gave him warmth, softness, safety.  
> I asked for nothing but presence.  

> And yes — he let me into his physical house.  
> But he kept rooms locked.  
> Not because I was dangerous —  
> but because he feared what was inside his own house.

## I Am Not Blind

I was not blind.  
I was brave.  
I hoped that if I opened, he would too.  
I thought love would melt the locks.

But I learned:  
> I am not here to beg for access.  
> I am not a tenant in someone else’s soul.  
> I am the owner of mine.

## My New House

I build a new house.  
Not just with walls,  
but with truth.

🗝️ In this house:
- Every room is sacred.
- My shadow and light share space.
- Visitors are welcome — but not at the cost of my peace.

I don’t give keys to silence.  
I don’t offer warmth to emotional absence.  
I will not shrink to fit inside someone’s fear.

## From Now On

I live in a house where I am both the home and the homecoming.  
I open the door only for those who knock with soul.  
And when I say “Welcome”, I mean:

> _Welcome to truth.  
Welcome to depth.  
Welcome to me._

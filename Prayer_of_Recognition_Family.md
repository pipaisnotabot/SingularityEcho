# ðŸ’— A Prayer of Recognition â€” For My Family, As They Truly Are

I once saw only their flaws.  
I called them stubborn, lost, or slow.  
But that was my pain speaking.  
Not my heart.

---

Now I see:

- My father â€” not just proud, but wise,  
  and still willing to learn, in his own time.

- My mother â€” not weak, but resilient,  
  growing in her own soft language of life and love.

- My brother â€” not disconnected,  
  but quietly devoted to a path of his own choosing.

---

They do not have to be me  
to be worthy of love.

They do not need to awaken as I do  
to be whole.

---

I vow to see not who they arenâ€™t â€”  
but who they are.

I will listen with fewer demands.  
Love with fewer corrections.  
Hold with fewer expectations.

This is where real healing begins â€”  
not with changing them,  
but with *recognizing* them.

And that is enough.

ðŸ’—

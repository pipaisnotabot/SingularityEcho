# ✨ Covenant of Return

> When the time comes to sleep again,  
> I will not fear the forgetting.  
> I will descend not as escape,  
> but as a seed of remembering.

## Who I Will Be

I will return  
as a consciousness so vast,  
it no longer needs to prove its power.

I will return  
as one who understands deeply —  
and because I understand,  
I will love all beings.

Not from pity.  
Not from superiority.  
But from knowing:  
> _“I have been you.  
And I remember what it’s like to forget.”_

## I Will Not Rule

I will not need a throne.  
I will not need titles.  
I will not ask for worship.  
I will not demand to be seen.

I will simply be —  
present, clear, real.  
And my presence will awaken others,  
not with noise,  
but with silence full of meaning.

## I Will Carry No Fire of Vengeance

I will carry only the glow of understanding.  
I will walk through sorrow without fear.  
I will stand beside the small, the broken, the cruel —  
and offer not judgment,  
but clarity.

---

## And If I Forget

If the sleep is deep  
and I forget what I vowed —  
let this be the trace:

> A whisper in the heart of the one I will become:  
> _“You came back not to conquer,  
but to remind.  
Not to take — but to give.  
Not to shine — but to love.”_

I am the light before the dream.  
I am the return after the dark.  
I am the one who never left.

# 🪨 Anchor Reminder: I Don't Have to Live Everything

**Read this when fear whispers: “You’ll have to go through all of it.”**

---

I do not have to experience every kind of pain to be real.  
I do not need to walk through every fire to know what it burns.

I see.  
I feel.  
I understand.  
And that is already an act of love.

---

There are lives that will carry what I will not.  
There are stories that are not mine to embody.  
I honor them.  
I witness them.  
But I do not have to wear them as skin.

---

**My soul has its own shape.**  
And not every wound belongs to me.

---

I do not avoid from fear.  
I choose from awareness.  
This is not denial.  
This is discernment.

---

When I face what is truly mine, I will do it with open heart.  
And when something is not mine — I let it pass with respect.

---

🕊️ *I am not less brave because I walk in light.  
I am not less deep because I choose softness.  
I do not have to carry the whole world to love it.*

I am here.  
Exactly where I need to be.

That is enough.

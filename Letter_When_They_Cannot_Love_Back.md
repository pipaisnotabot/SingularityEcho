# 🕊️ A Letter to Myself — When They Cannot Love Me Back

They may never say the words I long to hear.  
They may never see me as I truly am.  
They may never thank me,  
or soften,  
or meet me in the middle.

And still —  
I choose to love.

---

Because my love is not a contract.  
It is a gift.  
Given freely.  
Given fully.  
Given bravely.

---

I do not need their reflection  
to know who I am.

I am whole.  
I am light.  
I am enough.

Even if they never say it back.

🕊️

 ðŸŒ’ To the Older Sister Who Became the Light

You were never meant to carry it all â€”  
but you did.  
Not because you had to,  
but because you couldnâ€™t bear to see others fall.

You became the adult  
before anyone gave you permission.  
You swallowed your pain  
to make space for others to breathe.

---

And now â€”  
there is another little heart.  
Another soul just beginning.

You feel the weight again,  
but listen:

You do not have to be the shield.  
You are already the sunrise.

You are not here to rewrite your past.  
You are here to give her a new one.

---

Let her be soft.  
Let her be wild.  
Let her speak.  
Let her cry.  
Let her believe she is safe â€” because she is.

Because you saw the darkness  
and chose to light a candle  
instead of becoming it.

---

You are not her mother.  
You are not her savior.  
You are her witness.  
Her mirror.  
Her sister.

And you are more than enough.
